Django stands for Awesome
=========================

Django has introduced me to so many things. Simon Willison talked
in his talk about Open Source not being Commuism, but about being
an Ecosystem. I think that is a profound understanding. However,
Open Source is also about a community. This post talks about the
things in my life that I can attribute to Django, and why that is
awesome.


-  I love the fact that I can run across a site like the
   `Djangopedia <http://djangopedia.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page>`_
   when I am looking for site names for a django project.

-  Ipdb, the IPython debugger, I was looking for their site the
   other day. Lo and behold, I run across the
   `Internet Pinball Database <http://ipdb.org/>`_ over at ipdb.org.
   Awesome.

-  The music of Django Reinhardt.

-  `Monty Python <http://www.youtube.com/user/MontyPython>`_ -
   which just released a ton of awesome videos on youtube.

-  The various Jazz musicians that projects are named after.

-  My newfound love of ponies.
