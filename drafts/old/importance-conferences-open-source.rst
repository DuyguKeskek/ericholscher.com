The importance of conferences in Open Source
============================================

Talk with Niall, why is pycon so important? Djangocon? Would
communities fall apart without these meetings? Working with people
is so much fun when you put faces to names.

Old friends have yearly events to meet. Homecoming, Music
Festivals, etc. Are these seminal events necessary, a product of
the culture? It is our best way of disseminating information.
