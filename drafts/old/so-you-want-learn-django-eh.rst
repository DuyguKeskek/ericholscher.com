So, you want to learn Django eh?
================================

I have been hanging out in the #django IRC Channel on Freenode a
lot more lately. I found that when I was first learning Django,
seeing what people were having problems with and absorbing
information is a great way to learn. Now I use the channel as a way
to test my knowledge, and try to be helpful to the community. One
of the most often asked questions is, I want to learn Django, where
do I start? This post is meant to be a good pointer for things you
should know.

Django is Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are learning Django, you are learning Python. Knowing a
decent bit of python before diving into Django source makes your
life a lot easier. There are some common things in Python that may
be confusing to you in Django until you learn them.

Dive Into Python
''''''''''''''''

`Dive Into Python <http://diveintopython.org/>`_ is probably the
canonical free online reference for Python besides the official
documetation.

Official Documetation
'''''''''''''''''''''

The `Official Docs <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/>`_

`Pro Django <http://prodjango.com>`_ Chapter 2 provides the best
introduction here that I've seen, but that book is a bit heavy
quite yet. However, the topics it talks about are really useful
things to know when using Django:


-  Alex Gaynor talks about
   `how a Django Model is built <http://lazypython.blogspot.com/2008/11/how-heck-do-django-models-work.html>`_
