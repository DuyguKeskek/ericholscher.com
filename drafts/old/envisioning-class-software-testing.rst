Envisioning a class in software testing
=======================================

This is going to be a post talking about how you would teach a
class that shows the value of tests

I think a large value would be creating something real.

Write something, with tests. Come back to it a month later, see the
value in tests as documentation. See value as tests in
modifications being easier.

Tests are useful when working in groups.

Teach testing without them knowing (head fake). Be like "submit a
log of your program executing from the python shell". This can
later trivially be turned into a doctest.

Don't make it a "class about testing." Instill the value of testing
into your students in the intro level, and they will naturally do
it later. If there is enough interest, have testing/debugging (pdb)
class or something. "Learning your tools and language"

It's hard to show the real value of tests because software in
classes isn't real, and doesn't get maintained. -Perhaps give them
code from a previous year, some with tests and some without.
