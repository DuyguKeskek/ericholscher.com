Twinge
======

I read this rands post about the
`Twinge <http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2010/04/26/the_twinge.html>`_
the other day, and it got me thinking along those lines. I'd like
to tell a story about how a similar feeling that I find in
debugging.

I have Kong set up at work, to test basic functionality of our
sites. I get a msg that only applies to lcom/thedriveshow, and they
are the only ones running on old hardware. I've been getting these
random test pings.
