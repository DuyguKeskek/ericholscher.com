Awesome Django Tickets
======================

The Django trac has a ton of tickets in it. I think we're up past
12,000 now. While it is normally used for work within the
framework, everyone once in a while people have a little fun with
it. I want to point out some of my favorite tickets and moments in
the Django Trac. Yes, it is super nerdy, but I also think it
showcases a little bit of the fun that the community has.
