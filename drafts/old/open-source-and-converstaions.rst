Open Source and Converstaions
=============================

A lot of the time put into learning something is learning how to
think a certain way. Becoming literate in Literature means that you
acquire the concept of the propositional pronoun, and adverb
clause, and other scary sounding words. These things are merely
abstractions that are built on top of everyday things; allowing
people to talk about something at a higher level. Computer Science
is filled with these terms, that allow for a higher level
conversation to take place. Design patterns are a perfect example
of this.

So I'm going to talk about how Open Source allows you to have a
better conversation about you code. I believe that it allows you to
go about talking about things from a better starting point.
