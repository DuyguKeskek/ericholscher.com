What are the most important metrics for a site?
===============================================

With the release of Kong, and the other testing that I have been
thinking about, I have been thinking about what really matters with
your website. What is it that you really care about, that you
should be measuring. The old quip that what you measure becomes
what matters rings true. If you aren't seeing what happens to
certain aspects of your site, how can you really care about them?

There is a lot of what is talked about in the design realm.
However, in terms of functionality or performance, what do you
really need to make sure works?
