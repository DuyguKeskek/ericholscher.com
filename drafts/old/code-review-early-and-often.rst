Code review early and often
===========================

I have been working with my roommate
`Cody <http://codysoyland.com>`_ lately on some API code. We have
each been working on different parts, but we've been having a very
collaborative process, which has included talking each other
through most of our work when it's been at an early stage.

Throughout this process I have found some interesting problems and
ways of thinking about the larval stage of code. You know the
point, where you have something in your head and something half
worked out, but don't really know what it is going to turn into
once it's flushed out. I find that most people don't like sharing
code at this point, but I think there is a lot of value at this
point in the development process.

You are after the point of the idea, where everything sounds like
it will just work perfectly. You are just starting to implement the
ideas, and you're running into the first real constraints that
you've faced. Your starting to get a feel for the problem, and you
can see where the friction is starting to develop.
