Running Django Tests with Other Frameworks
==========================================

Django has it's own testing framework, that is based on Python's
builtin unittest package. However, the Python community has a
couple of other large testing frameworks that are out there as
third party packages. The two biggest that I know about are
`nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`_ and
`py.test <http://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/>`_
