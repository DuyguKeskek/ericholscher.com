Some great Django Software
==========================

Currently in the Django (Python?) Community, there isn't a good
place to go and find what are the 'best of breed' apps for certain
categories. There have been some rumblings of fixing these, and if
things like `DJApp <http://djapp.org/>`_ caught on, we might have
that ability. However, I'm going to go ahead and list some of the
applications that I use and think are just great. Please comment
here and talk about other ones you love, or feel free to write your
own post as well.
