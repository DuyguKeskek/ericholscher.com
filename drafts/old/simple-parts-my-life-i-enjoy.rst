linked this awesome
`Commencement Speech <http://web.archive.org/web/20080213082423/http://www.marginalia.org/dfw_kenyon_commencement.html>`_
by David Foster Wallace today, and it got me thinking.

It talks about the importance of controlling the things that you
think about. Your thoughts own you, and what you think is how you
feel. If you go every day experiencing things like people are out
to get you, then you won't have any fun in life. So I decided to
keep it short (this could easily turn into a rant), and post about
the little things that I enjoy in my life most days.


-  Blueberries with cereal in the morning
-  Taking the long way to work on my bike, while listening to good
   music
-  The wonderful array of music that there is on my little ipod
-  The fact that I enjoy and am engaged in what I do on a daily
   basis
-  My company supports and believes in Open Source
-  The wealth of information available to me at all times (thanks
   internet!)
-  Good friends
