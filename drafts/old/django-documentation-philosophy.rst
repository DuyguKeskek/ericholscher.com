Django documentation philosophy
===============================

There is a lot of power in the python language. Django is a
framework that is implemented in and on that language. I was
talking to Jacob the other day about Django's documentation
philosophy in regards to python. He said that they try to not
document what is already documented in the python documentation. It
is the same way that django doesn't re-implement functionality that
is found in python, it is simply a layer on top.

We were discussing this before the Django documentation refactor,
and I think that they do a much better job of pointing to the
Python documentation in the new versions. A lot of places they
quote the python documentation minimally, then provide a link to
the further documentation. I think this is a really good way to do
it.
