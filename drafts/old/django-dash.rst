Django Dash
===========

The Django Dash is a really neat competition where teams are given
a weekend to build something awesome in Django. It is a really neat
way to show how productive you can be using a framework, and it
gives you a chance to hack together a neat site. You also get the
chance to win cool prizes to boot!

My co-worker `Daniel <http://www.toastdriven.com/>`_ is running it,
and I think that it will be a lot of fun this year. The more the
merrier, so go register and compete in making something awesome!
