Things that my 22 year old self is telling my 32 year old self
==============================================================

There are so many posts out there about what you would tell
yourself when you were young. This is great, and I love
`reading them <http://jonbischke.com/2009/04/24/the-5-things-id-tell-my-21-year-old-entrepreneurial-self/>`_.
This post is going to be the opposite, being the things that my 22
year old self knows and does, that I think I don't want to forget.

Live by the beach someday.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Living by the beach through high school was some of the happiest
times of your life.

Do something amazing.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Travel every month.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It doesn't matter how far, but go see something new and interesting
every month!

Live as a tourist.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Don't become compliacent in your situation. Rediscover the beauty
of your current time and place. There is so much around you that
you don't know about.

Don't care what others think
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A lot harder than it looks. Especially when concerning peer groups
and people that you look up to. Live fearlessly.
