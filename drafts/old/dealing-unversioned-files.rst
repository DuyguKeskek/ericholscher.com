Dealing with unversioned files
==============================

At work, we have situations where we have clients who have access
to their own templates for a Django site. It is up to the clients
to maintain versions of these, but in the past we have found it
useful to version these templates to make it easier for them.

Paste script, talk about benefits (checkins over time, hard data).
