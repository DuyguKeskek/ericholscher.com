Consulting
==========

I have worked in the dcumentation work for over 7 years.
My primary projects are:

-  The community site, https://readthedocs.org, which is the `largest`_ open source documentation hosting site in the world.
-  The community conference, `Write the Docs`_, which is the largest community documentation conference in the USA, and growing in Europe.

I help use this experience to help you understand how to leverage
documentation in your business.

Having great documentation lowers your support costs, gets users
onboarded faster, and is a requirement for shipping quality software. We
are experts in the tools and process that produce great documentation.
Help us improve how your company does documentation today.
