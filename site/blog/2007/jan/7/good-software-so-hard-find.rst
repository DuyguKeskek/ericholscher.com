Good Software is SO hard to find..
===================================

I just installed Songbird which is a really neat music player built
on top of XUL (of firefox fame). It's cross platform (yey good
Linux support) and is currently only a developer release. It's
working great for me and I'm excited about the possibilities. One
pet peeve is that it didn't have a systray icon for it, one feature
that i've grown accustomed to. Browsing their forms someone pointed
to Alltray, which allows you to launch a program "alltray program",
and it will automatically create a systray icon for it. COOL! How
have I not heard of this before?
