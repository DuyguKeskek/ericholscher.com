iPhone
======

Apple just released the iPhone today. This looks like a paradigm
shift in the world of mobile phones. It's amazing how much a
company can innovate when it doesn't have it's own silly motives to
protect. Most other companies have 'walled gardens' or their own
internet that they are trying to make money off of, so they don't
offer Wifi access. It runs OS X, how long until this thing gets
VoIP compatibility? They are Partnering with Cingular, so they may
nix that idea, but it has to be on everyone's minds. The iPhone
looks damned impressive, and if you go to their site you can see
the amazing prototype.
