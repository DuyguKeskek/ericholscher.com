Updating website
=================

I'm starting to update my website, moving everything from .shtml
over to cgi's because it's easier. Also building out my web-based
lyrics script to include saying lyrics are bad or good. Also trying
to figure out a good way to automatically get all of the lyrics
from an artist whenever one is found. Then run this in the
background and they will be in the database cached when requested.

Also thinking of displaying a directory of artists, or even an AJAX
interface to typing in the artist names and it has suggestions.
That is seriously cool and might be able to be accomplished, and
done well. We'll see how things go, I might even get credit in my
AJAX class for doing the lyrics thing. I only had time to do
research getting all of an artists songs today. In the spare time i
have between 15 credits and 12 hrs a week at my internship. Time is
scarce, and needs to be spent doing creative things. :)
