Browser Tabs
============

My first four browser tabs have been the same for the past couple
hours. The first is the root of all evils, and the other three are
productive!

Tab1: Google Reader (1000+) Tab2: Beautiful Soup documentation:
awesome HTML parsing library that i'm trying to learn to scrape
events websites. Tab3: Dive Into Python: Time to learn Python as
well as learning Django... Tab4: My website! w00t! Making small
progress....

Updated the OpenID libraries to make them smell better. Added
little parts to my blog, and around the site, little small
updates.
