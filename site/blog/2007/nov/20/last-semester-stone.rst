Last semester in stone
======================

Registered for classes today, pretty excited about my schedule. My
last semester senior year isn't going to be a cake walk like it
should be (because i'm lazy), but it's going to be much better than
this one. Taking the second part of my Physics lab (required) and 2
PE classes, tennis and weight training, fulfilling all of my
required classes for the school. I'm going to be continuing my
senior Independent Study Project, for another 3 credits. I'll be
taking a 300-level CS database class to round out my Compsci
Education. I will then also either be taking discrete math or intro
to film studies, pass/fail. If discrete doesn't look like it'll be
too much work i'll take them, if not i'll do film studies and
coast.

I'm excited about taking the database class. I feel that is one of
the few wholes in my CompSci theory education, and it was the one
class I was sorry I hadn't gotten to take. I don't understand DB's
well at all, and this class should fix that. It will make me a
better web developer, and understanding of DB logic is applicable
to a lot of the field, in the form of data storage and data
relationships.
