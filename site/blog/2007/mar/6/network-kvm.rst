Network KVM
===========

This neat little program lets you use your network as a KVM. You
set up a 'server' computer where you use the mouse and keyboard,
and then 'client' computers on the right of left of your server,
and when you go off the screen of the server, it automagically goes
to control the mouse and KB of the client machine. Really neat.
