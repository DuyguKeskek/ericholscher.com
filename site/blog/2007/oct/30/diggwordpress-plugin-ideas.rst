Digg/Wordpress plugin ideas
===========================

A lot of websites have those annoying 'digg this' buttons, with 0
diggs on it. How silly that makes them look. I feel like an idiot
reading a web page that nobody else cares about...

How about implementing a feature (wp plugin?) that checks the diggs
for each of your posts, and only includes the digg button on it
when the number of diggs reachs N (20?).

Also, what if digg/reddit/etc. created a protocol that notifies a
website when a post of theres is promoted to the front page, and
even maybe integrate it into wordpress (blogging engine x), where
it would be alerted if the post was on the front page (like a
trackback), and then automatically make the page static instead of
dynamic, presumably not crashing the server...?
