Funding Open Source with Marketing Money
=========================================

Often times as developers we see funding open source as a charity.
We will give our personal money to projects we believe in.
If we're lucky,
our company might have a matching donation program for OSS projects big enough to be inside an official non-profit.
However,
this has `proven`_ not to be a sustainable way to support open source.

Over the years working on Read the Docs,
we've tried a large number of ways to get sustainable funding.
We've done:

* Donations on Gittip
* Corporate fundraising drives
* Support Contracts
* Contracting on documentation tooling
* Training for documentation

However,
at the end of the day doing this work takes away from the primary goal of providing a documentation hosting site.
These are all side-businesses that take time and focus away from our primary goal as a project.

At the end of the day,
we've settled on `advertising`_ as the way forward.
We believe that it aligns out incentives are publishers,
as the more projects and users we serve,
the more money that we're able to make.
It also is the only viable business model that seems to work for large,
free websites on the internet.

Traditional Open Source Funding
-------------------------------

Saying that we're building an advertising business to support open source isn't overly interesting on it's face.
However,
I want to look at this from a different perspective in terms of where the money comes from.
This Ford Foundation `report`_ goes into much more depth here,
but I want to cover it in broad strokes.

Historically,
open source funding has come from:

* Donation budgets from individuals, who are very likely to also produce Open Source themselves
* Donation budgets form corporations, which are vanishingly small
* Technical budgets from Engineering organizations within corporations

The last one is the least obvious.
Fitting donations into your expenses forces OSS funding into something that appears to be a legitimate business expense.
Traditionally this has been in the form of "enterprise licenses" which provide no benefit,
toothless "support" contracts,
or other tricks to make the money come from another source in the budget.

You'll notice a trend in the above funding sources:

* They are generally one-time payments instead of recurring
* They are the first expenses to be cut 
* They are generally less than 1% of a total organizations budget

Marketing Money
---------------

Traditionally,
open source funding has been attempting to scrape by with a tiny percentage of the overall company budget.
In a lot of tech companies,
the marketing and sales teams will account for up to half of the budget for the company.
This money has been generally untouched by open source tools.

Focusing on doing advertising allows us to use this huge pile of money,
and redirect it to fund open source software.
We're unlocking a source of funding that was traditionally closed off,
and which has a lot more money.

**If you work at a company that sells to developers and believe in the work that Read the Docs does,
it would be great to point your marketing folks at us.**
We have an audience of developers that almost certainly is interesting to them,
and the money that might have historically gone to Google or Facebook will go to a worthwhile open source project.

We're building an advertising platform that is ethical and `open source`_.
We hope it will be a way to create ongoing sustainable funding for Read the Docs,
and other parts of the open source world as a whole.
