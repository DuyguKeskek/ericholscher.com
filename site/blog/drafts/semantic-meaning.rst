Semantic meaning in Documentation
==================================

.. note:: Subtitled: Why you're doing documentation wrong
		  Sub-Subtitled: Don't you respect your ideas?

Over the years,
we've learned that seperating semantic and display login in HTML is a good thing.
What we mean and what we show someone are very different things.
For example,
we might want to note something in documentation,
but not want to think about what that might look like to the user.
This flexibility gives us a lot of value as an author,
in that I can write what I want to say,
without thinking about how it might look.

Transferring information in prose is a much different skill than transferring it in interface.
In fact,
we don't even group these people together in the same schools in college.
Interface Design and English aren't seen as symbiotic fields.
In the process of producing documentation however,
they are two sides of the same coin.

When you write documentation in Markdown,
there is no clear way to represent ideas.
You only have markup at your disposale.
As an author,
this means that you are limited in how much data you can transfer at an absolute level.
When you write something and make it bold,
what are you saying?

This doesn't even get into the issue of other formats.
When you write something in Markdown,
how do you link to another page in the docs?
Do you use relative links?
What happens when you want to turn that into a PDF?
What happens when you want to break your document into multiple volumes?

The question I want people to ask,
what happens when you respect your ideas?
What happens when you want to make sure that your idea is recieved by the reader?

What happens when you make your words live?
