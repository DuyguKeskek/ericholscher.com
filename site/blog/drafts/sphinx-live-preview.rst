Sphinx Live Preview
===================

For a long time, 
there has been a live preview site for reStructuredText: http://rst.ninjs.org/
I have thought about making one that supported Sphinx for a while.
So, I forked the codebase and created one.

I present: http://livesphinx.herokuapp.com/

It is still very much a work in progress.
The output should be themed nicely,
and support syntax highlighting.
If you have any feedback or requests,
please `tweet`_ or `email`_ me.

This work was done as part of my :doc:`ongoing work </blog/2013/sep/25/help-me-improve-documentation>` to improve documentation.
If you think this work is important,
you should `support me on Gittip`_.
