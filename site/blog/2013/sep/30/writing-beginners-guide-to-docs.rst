Writing a Beginners Guide to Documentation
==========================================

A few days ago I :doc:`started a campaign </blog/2013/sep/25/help-me-improve-documentation>` to improve documentation.
Today I have the first results to show from this work.

It started first with a `presentation`_ that I presented at PDX Python here in Portland.
The talk was very well received,
so I decided to write it up.

So, I present `A beginners guide to writing documentation`_.
It is still very much a work in progress,
so I hope that you can provide feedback.
The idea behind the presentation and document is to allow people modify and present it themselves.
I am hoping to build documents and presentations for other aspects of documentation as well.
If you want to give this presentation,
I would love for you to `email me`_.

As I said,
this work was done as part of my ongoing work on Documentation.
If you think this work is important,
you should `support me on Gittip`_.
