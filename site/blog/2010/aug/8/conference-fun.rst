Conference Fun
==============

It's conference season and I realized that I haven't talked about
any of the ones that I've been to or am going to, so I figured it
would be a good post.

Djangocon US
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Djangocon US <http://djangocon.us>`_ is just around the corner,
and I'm getting excited about going back to Portland for another
year. The conference is being held in the second week of September
(7-9th) with
`sprints <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2009/nov/16/you-should-stay-sprints/>`_
afterwards. I will be speaking again at Djangocon, talking about
the awesome applications that the Python community has put
together. Modeled and named after my blog series "Large Problems,
Mostly Solved", and the
`full desciption <http://djangocon.us/schedule/sessions/32/>`_ is
available on the Djangocon site. The
`full schedule <http://djangocon.us/schedule/>`_ of speakers has a
little bit for everyone.

My friend Danny has been
`highlighting <http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/08/getting-excited-about-djangocon-us.html>`_
some of the
`talks <http://pydanny.blogspot.com/2010/08/more-reasons-to-go-to-djangocon.html>`_
and other reasons he's also excited about going this year on his
blog. It's a great oppertunity to meet up with all the members of
the community and see them present ideas that they have been
working on, and it really makes you appreciate the scope of the
Django world. I highly recommend going for anyone who is interested
in or doing Django developement.

Strange Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Strange Loop <http://strangeloop2010.com/>`_ is a conference right
around the corner in St Louis, Mo. It is a general developer
conference, without any kind of specific focus besides being
awesome. The keynotes that I'm super excited about are Douglas
Crockford (Author of
`Javascript: The Good Parts <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook>`_)
and Guy Steele (whos
`Growing a Language <http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8860158196198824415#>`_
talk is excellent).

I think a crew of us from Lawrence are going to go, and the
`full speaker list <http://strangeloop2010.com/speakers>`_ doesn't
fail to disappoint. I think it will be a really interesting
experience, with lots of different communities coming together.

Djangocon EU
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Djangocon EU <http://djangocon.eu>`_ is the Django communities
conference in Europe. It was held in Berlin this year, and was a
smashing success. It was the first conference run by the community,
and I think the organizers did a fantastic job with the food,
talks, venue, and general galavanting around Berlin that ensued.

I realized that I forgot to post the slides to my talk afterwards,
so I'll go ahead and post it here for posterity. It is a talk about
Continuous Integration, Testing, and some of the tools and utils in
that realm. If you haven't seen it before, I hope you learn
something:

I know that I love software conferences, especially Open Source
oriented ones (I've never been to another kind :). So I hope to see
(or that I saw you) at one of these awesome events.
