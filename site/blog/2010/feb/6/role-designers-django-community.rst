The role of designers in the Django community
=============================================

*\* UPDATE*\*: There is a new thread about the
`roles and implementation of a Design Czar <http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/18bca037f10769e9>`_
up on the Django Developers mailing list. Please contribute there
as well, if you have thoughts and ideas.

There has been a
`recent discussion <http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/ca4f26d616921753>`_
on the
`Django Developers <http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/>`_
mailing list about the role of designers in the Django community. I
think that this is an interesting discussion that can come from
this, and I would like to explain my thoughts on the issue.

This discussion came up in the context of redesigning the Django
Admin, which everyone knows and loves. The UI is growing a bit
out-dated, and there was talk of working to clean it up. This then
turned into a discussion about how design proposals and
improvements aren't taken as seriously as they should be by the
community. I think there are a number of reasons that this happens,
and I would like to take a look at them. My purpose here is to
start a discussion about how to better integrate designers into the
community, because they are a vital part of making our world more
beautiful and efficient.

I don't trust myself to judge your work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The normal process for changes that go into Django is that a
proposal is sent to the mailing list. There is a discussion that
happens around them, and then if the code is produced, and it
works, it gets committed. For design changes, I don't reply to
these messages, because I don't have the skills or knowledge to
judge the work. I think that a lot of people on these lists are in
the same boat.

When someone sends a proposal to the list, and it doesn't get any
replies, that feels like rejection. This happens more than it
should, but it isn't anyones job to respond to these messages and
say "sorry, I'm not qualified to critique your work". This happens
with code proposals too, but I think it may happen more with
design. This leads to designers forsaking the mailing list, and
this problem perpetuates itself, by not drawing designers into the
community.

Design is not special, except when it is
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Part of the problem that seems to have come forward is that there
is a feeling that design is "special". That it should be treated
somehow differently in the process. As we know from history, even
with all good intentions, different is never equal. So I think that
we should work to fit design into the current scheme of how things
work, instead of trying to adopt new ways of dealing with it.

When I look at the current Core Developers of Django, I don't see
many people who are designers. As I said above, that fact that very
few of the current core developers are well versed in the design
realm, really hurts inclusion of design changes. This creates a lot
more friction in the process of getting design changes into the
code base.

I don't know if this idea is crazy, but should we have the concept
of a "core designer". These would be people that the community
trusts and knows have good taste, that would be an obvious person
to make these design choices. I think that there is a problem when
I have a design change for Django, and I really don't know who to
talk to. There is an obvious authority (BDFL) for code changes, but
I don't know if Adrian and Jacob are really the correct people to
making these judgment calls on design?

I realize that this is open source, and "core designers" would be
the same as developers, just people who care about the direction of
the projects design. However, I think that having more design
oriented people in the community in a more direct fashion would
make it more obvious that design changes are welcomed and seriously
considered.

I don't know how far we need to go down the path of making this
explicit. However, most of the documentation about contributing is
explicit about "code". This is another of those lines, where I
don't know if it makes sense to be explicit about design, having a
"design" section in the contributing documentation, or if the
implicit knowledge of core designers will make it obvious that we
mean design changes there too.

The actual process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I don't want to talk about the actual design process, because well,
I really don't know how it works. I think that once we integrate
designers into the community better, the process for design will
naturally fall out better.

Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

I would like to point out that Django has some of the best
designers of any open source community out there. I am lucky to
work with a number of them on a daily basis, and I really think
that they make our community special. So thank you guys for
sticking with us.

This is a place where I could see Django leading the way in how to
integrate design into the open source development process. Let's
make a grand experiment, and see how it works out.
