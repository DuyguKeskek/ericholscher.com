Django Testing Mailing List
===========================

I have a couple of testing related applications in the Django
community. I don't have a good way of communicating with the users
of these apps, namely about releases, or helping with support
questions. So I am starting the
`Django Testing Mailing List <http://groups.google.com/group/django-testing>`_
for people that are interested in my testing projects:
django-test-utils, django-crawler, and django-kong.

This is kind of an experiment of a combined mailing list for a
couple of different projects. Hopefully people that are interested
in one will be interested in the others, so we'll see how it goes.

If you have a testing related app for Django that doesn't have a
good place to discuss, feel free to make it your home as well.

**Note**: This is more a place to discuss issues my django
applications. If you are interested in testing, the
`Testing in Python <http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/testing-in-python>`_
list and the #python-testing IRC channel on Freenode are both great
resources as well.
