Earthquakes in politics
=======================

An interesting opinion piece that I read at work in the NY Times
today. Talks about how Obama and Huckabee both embody vastly
different philosophies of government than the previous established
order. It gives me hope to hear them discribed that way. Hopefully
the existing governmental structures won't sink their hopes and
dreams for this once-great country of ours. Two Earthquakes

Related, a blog I read linked to a quote from Huckabee about
education that I found inspirational, showing his very interesting
and worthy outlook.

From Iowa winner Mike Huckabee: "Education is only a true education
if we're developing both the left and right brain of the student .
. . . Take a room of 5-year-olds and give them a piece of paper and
crayon and every one of them draws a picture. When he's 15 that kid
won't draw the picture or sing the song. Somehow the education
system beat out of him or her the creativity that was innate in
that student."
