Hackers and Painters
====================

Just finished reading Hackers and Painters by Paul Graham. It was
an amazing book about the past, present, and future of computers.
Lots of stuff about programming, but also fulfilling for people
that don't know much about computers as well looking outside in. It
explains a lot and is an amazing read. Paul Graham is an amazing
Essayist and it shines through in this book. It contains 15
unrelated essays, and is highly recommended.
