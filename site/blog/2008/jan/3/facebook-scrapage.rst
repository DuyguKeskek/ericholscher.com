Facebook Scrapage
=================

I'm thinking about how to implement facebook's social graph in my
Events calendar application. It would be a big boon for my site if
when people signed up, they could automatically have their facebook
friends imported as their friends on my site. However, I don't like
the idea of having to have the person give me their login
information to do this. (This is what OAuth is for!).

However, facebook lets me see all of the people at Mary Washington
on it, and it lets me look at all of their friends. I'm thinking
that I might be able to scrape facebook automatically when someone
signs up, using my account, to atleast import basic information
about their friends. This isn't as easy or useful as a full API
that facebook could easily provide, but it would be a start, and a
cool app to write!
