Code on Launchpad
=================

The code for the website is now located on launchpad. I am using
their bazaar version control system that is kick ass. It's a
Distributed VCS which means that you can run it completely locally,
without a server. I use the server of course, but it allows you to
do work on your code without internet access and other neat
things.

Also testing an update to the Django basic blog that should allow
blog posts to show up without restarting the server (big bug!)
