My dad was wikipedia
====================

For most of my life my dad has been my wikipedia. Long before it
existed, anything I had a question about, I could ask him and be
assured to either be given an insightful answer, or a logically
thought out answer that amazingly always seemed to be correct. I
think this is the basis for the constant curiosity that still
exists in myself.

When you can ask why about everything and be given an answer, it
only leads to more why's. An analogy to the academics dilemma. The
more you know, the more you know you don't know. I had a
never-ending stream of why's and a never-ending stream of answers.
Looking back I find this to be one of the greatest influences in my
life thus far.

The killer feature of wikipedia will be when it can understand my
questions and provide insight into them. Searching and
link-following are great and all, but the inherent context matching
of intelligence that can be provided by a real live human is
unmatched by computer.
