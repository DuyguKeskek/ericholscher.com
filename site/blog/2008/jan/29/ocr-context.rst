OCR with context
================

OCR should use context, when it sees the word 'everythxxg', it
should know that the 'xx' is 'in'. This is how the human brain
works, and is how the computer should work too. If Google can
suggest spelling suggestions to my misspelled words, there is no
reason that this technology couldn't be applied to OCR. It would
make it much more powerful and useful.
