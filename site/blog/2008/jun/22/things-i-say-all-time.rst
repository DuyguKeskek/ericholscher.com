Things I say all the time
=========================

I just got around to updating my profiles and online stuffs
(Graduating, Moving, and getting a new job will do that!). I just
updated my "about me" section, and threw in some things that I say
way too often (My friends can vouch for this). Anyway, I think they
say a lot about me (and are said a lot by me)...

Awkward is a state of mind.

I don't believe in Boredom.

Do what you love; Love what you do.

Appreciate the present!

Cheers!
