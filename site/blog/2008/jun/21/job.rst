JOB!!
=====

Eek! The job starts Monday! That is like, 36 hours from now. I'm
really excited and slightly nervous. The excited feeling comes from
the place I'll be working. For posterities sake, here is the series
of interactions that landed me the job:

Senior Project
''''''''''''''

Start using Django and Python to learn the Python language. Fall in
love with Django pretty close to the beginning of the project.

Thanksgiving
''''''''''''

I read most of the Django documentation PDF in the Virgin Islands
over break, and really fall in love.

April
'''''

Start applying for jobs, and decide to work with Perl or Python.
Decide working with Django would be awesome! The people who
invented it are hiring, why not go straight to the source...

Their job posting
'''''''''''''''''

Unofficially, the job description is "build cool shit." Our goals
are nothing short of being the coolest and most innovative web
teams in the world. We're the people newsrooms come to when they
need to implement special features and new sites, but we do a whole
lot more:

Sounds awesome!

My e-mail to them

Title: Junior Developer with extreme ass-kicking skills

Body: I've been a huge fan of LAMP style development for a good 4
years. I started using Perl and have switched to using Django and
Python for my latest project (very impressed). I attached my
resume, and my current site is http://www.fredvents.com It still
isn't launched, but getting closer everyday. I've heard a lot about
Lawrence from my friend I met from there while studying aboard in
Australia. Wakarusa is a big draw, as well as the amazing music
scene.

My resume is attached with more examples of my work and other
formalities.

Cheers, Eric Holscher

And the rest is history waiting to be made! I start Monday!!!
