Year in Review
==============

Well it's been a crazy roller coaster year for me. So this post is
going to be the typical recap of what's gone on with my life and my
blog over the past year. I'm really happy with where I'm at both
professionally and personally, and 2008 has been an interesting
year for me.

Last semester and Graduation
----------------------------

It's kind of surreal to think that at the beginning of this year, I
was still a senior at the
`University of Mary Washington <http://umw.edu>`_, living in
Virginia with some of my best friends in an awesome house. My final
semester senior year was a lot of fun, I took very little in the
way of course work. I was employed by
`CACI <http://www.caci.com/index2.shtml>`_, which is a defense
contractor at the
`Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren <http://www.nswc.navy.mil/>`_.
I was doing Java, Javascript, and a little Perl code for a Navy
portal at the base. It was a really fun job socially, but the
technology (other than Javascript libraries) was pretty dull.

At school I was finishing up my senior/honors project using Django.
This turned out to have probably been the most important decision
of my college career (hindsight being 20/20). I went to the
`National Conference on Undergraduate Research <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/feb/11/ncur-22/>`_
to present the ideas from my senior project. This was a really neat
place, and I was exposed to a lot of interesting things other
people were doing.

We had a really crazy Primary Election season, which included
`Bill Clinton <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/feb/11/bill-clinton/>`_
talking at my school, which I saw. Obama also later spoke at UMW
(His famous in the rain speech), which i would have died to see.

I applied for a
`couple different jobs <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/feb/20/job-hunt/>`_
all over the country after I graduated. I had phone interviews with
Yelp, a Wiki startup, and a couple other places. I interviewed and
was offered a job by `Zope <http://zope.com/>`_ which randomly is
based in the town I went to college in. I also applied at
`The World Company <http://www.mediaphormedia.com/>`_, the
birthplace of Django in the middle of the country, Kansas. I got
offered the Jobs at Zope and the World Company, so I had to choose
which to pick. As I've talked about before, I chose Kansas, and it
has all been a blur since. I
`graduated <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/feb/3/graduate/>`_
from UMW.

The epic journeys
-----------------

I
`accepted the job <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/jun/21/job/>`_
right before graduation at the end of April, subsequently quitting
my old job at CACI. I arranged to start in Lawrence on July 1,
giving me all of May and June to enjoy summer. I had some decent
savings and decided to move to Lawrence with no money, and to
travel a bunch before I went.

Over those 2 months I took a bunch of different trips. I went to
`Boston for a week <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/jun/2/goodbye-east-coast/>`_,
going to Barcamp Boston, which was the first conference I'd ever
been to. I met some amazing people and got really excited about the
culture that surrounds the profession that I had chosen. I also
just got to tour around MIT and Harvard, met some great people
through friends, and just had a great experience.

I also went down to North Carolina, and to the
`Outer Banks <http://www.outerbanks.org/index.asp>`_. The Outer
Banks are one of my favorite places on earth, and totally recommend
them to anyone. They have some of the best waves on the East Coast,
and a completely relaxed and beautiful beach atmosphere. I really
hit the beach hard because I was moving to KANSAS!

I went to Maryland to a friends late graduation party, and to visit
family that I don't see very often, even less often now that I live
in Kansas. I also went all around Virginia, to Nelson County to
visit my friend Josh's house. Charlottesville to see some music and
visit friends. Virginia Beach (Home) a little bit to go surfing and
visit friends and family. Berryville (where I grew up) to visit old
friends and the rest of my family.

So at the end of June, I move out of my house, and leave for
Kansas. Great first half of the year.

Lawrence Chronicles
-------------------

I was
`in love with Lawrence <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/jun/14/lawrence-day-1/>`_
on the first day. It's a great town and I love it to death. I moved
into a `Co-op <http://www.lawrencecoop.org/uksha/Olive.html>`_ for
July-August so that I could find a place to lease and have an
instant social network. The people I lived with were amazing, and
it turns out that one of my co-workers had lived there while she
was in college!
`Cool <http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericholscher/2675719446/>`_.

The job at the World Company turned out to be amazing, working with
`lots <http://postneo.com/>`_ `of <http://mintchaos.com/>`_
`brilliant <http://www.b-list.org/>`_
`people <http://playgroundblues.com/>`_. On my second week on the
job,
`DjangoCon <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/jul/7/djangocon-2008/>`_
was announced. It's really neat feeling like you fell right in the
middle of something amazing going on. I had a hunch from afar, but
it turned out to be more true than I could imagine.

My birthday was on July 9, and right around my Birthday I was added
to Django's Community Aggregator. This was the first time that my
blog had ever gotten more than 20 hits a day (and all those 10+
were when I sent my resumes around). I started getting people
reading the things I was writing, and actually appreciating what I
was saying. It's really neat to have a way to talk to people, and
have them be excited and listen to what you say.

At the end of july, I
`released <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/jul/23/automating-tests-django/>`_
my first open source project, testmaker. This was met with a great
response from the community. This is where I really started to
appreciate and understand the value of the open source community. I
got great feedback, inspiration from comments, and a great dialogue
around the project. It is tiny compared to some of the things that
people do, but I was floored with the response.

Djangocon was in September and was more amazing than I could have
anticipated. I gave an incredibly nervous lightning talk (having
broken my demo 5 mins before I went on, and fixed it). I learned so
much, got to meet some amazing people, and had lots of fun. I see
now that I didn't do a writeup post, which is sad.

November was
`post-a-day month <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/nov/30/post-day-review/>`_
that was a lot of work but very rewarding. I did it with a lot of
other people in the community and I think it was a great effort and
it worked out really well.

December was really laid back. I started a couple more
`projects <http://ericholscher.com/projects/>`_ which are going to
be getting some love in the new year. I went to Jamaica on
vacation, and went back to Virginia to visit friends and family for
2 weeks.

Wow
---

A lot of things have happened this year, and I'm grateful for where
I am and what I'm doing. It's been an amazing ride, and I can only
guess as to how 2009 will be. I'm sure it will be another great
year, and things are only looking up. I want to thank everyone for
reading my blog, and I want to wish everyone a happy new year full
of blessings and insights.

Happy new year!!
