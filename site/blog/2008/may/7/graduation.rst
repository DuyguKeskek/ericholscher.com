Graduation
==========

Three days until graduation. I'm getting really excited. Getting
all of my stuff in order to go out to Kansas, and enjoying the rest
of my summer. I'll start posting more frequently soon hopefully,
since I'll have lots of free time, and need to be getting into
programming mode for my job. Super super super excited about life
right now!!!
