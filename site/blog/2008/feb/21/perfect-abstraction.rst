Perfect Abstraction
===================

Here in computer science land, the quest is for the perfect
abstraction. That's what our job is anyway, Software Engineer my
ass, more like lead abstraction implementer. This quest for the
perfect abstraction is never-ending, and certainly cannot be
attained by humans. We aren't capable of creating bug-free
software, so our abstractions will be inherently leaky. If it
wasn't leaky, then it wouldn't be abstracted.

Today I was doing some brainstorming in class and came to the
conclusion that paper is the perfect abstraction for our minds. The
ideas, words, or pictures that you put on a piece of paper have
meaning. However, the way that you put them down only has meaning
to you. Others might be able to grasp why it is laid out the way it
is, but true free form brainstorming I feel is inherently
meaningful, but the ideas cannot be translated easily. It has some
abstract meaning to you, but the meaning is in the relation of the
objects on the paper and in your head. Presumably if the ideas
could be laid out more succinctly with words they would have been.
So in the terms of abstraction perfection, I think that it is one
of the few examples we have of a perfect abstraction.

Of course, this means that you assume the brain, if only we could
do that in CompSci. It would make things a lot easier :) Perfect
cognitive relations are out of reach for a little while longer...
