Website Interface Design
========================

I plan to design the events site through the lense of the user. The
UI philosophy is thought about in that way. We don't ask how to
design a page about adding an event to the calendar. We ask what
the user wants to do when putting something on the calendar. What
are the use cases of the calendar, why is the user there. This ties
in with what makes our cal better than other cals. Trying to make
the UI amazing.
