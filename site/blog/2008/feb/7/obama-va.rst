Obama & Va
==========

I'm really excited that Obama "won" Super Tuesday. He got more
states and more votes, and has been declared the winner, even
though Hilary is only like 5 votes behind. I'm glad that Virginia
is actually important this primary season, and I think this is the
first time I will ever vote. I have never had a good reason to vote
before, but Obama is such an inspiration. As is almost cliche these
days, he is actually inspiring me to get out and vote! That is no
small undertaking, and I believe a large part of how he is doing so
well. Young people aren't apathetic, all previous candidates have
just been God Awful.

I also love this onion piece about the candidates and their stances
on Iraq, so funny.

Hillary Clinton: "I would never have voted for the war had we known
it would become unpopular."

In closing, here's to kicking out Bush! :) The original homeland
security
