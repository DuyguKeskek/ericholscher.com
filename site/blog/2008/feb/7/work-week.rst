Work this week 
===============

At work this week I've been tasked with using PL/SQL (Oracles
version of SQL scripting) to create traverse a tree structure
stored in a database. The data is stored in a simple tree, with
each node having an id, and a parent\_id. When the parent\_id is
null, then that means it is a root node. This structure will be
used to display navigational links for pages in an automatic
fashion.

I found a couple useful websites that have helped me do this, so
I'll link them here for future reference.
