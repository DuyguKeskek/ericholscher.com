Graduate
========

Was talking to an old friend today. My friend Shane who graduate
from Georgia Tech with a degree in Electrical Engineering. He's
currently in Cali, with a cool job somewhat related to his major. I
was talking to him about the current situation (graduation
approaches),and he has an amazingly apt drawing.
