My Second Poem Ever
===================

Watched Dead Poets Society about 3 times in the last 2 weeks, and
was inspired in the ways of rhyme and rhythm. Here's a poem,
loosely based on one of my favorite quotes.."The more you know, the
more you know you don't know"..

Untitled. 

| When the Light out is stronger than the light within.
| Don't be afraid to let it begin.
| The torch of knowledge, torch of soul.
| The torch neverending. Light; a toll.
