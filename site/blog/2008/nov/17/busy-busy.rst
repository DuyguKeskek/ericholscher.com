Busy Busy
=========

So at work since I started for
`Mediaphormedia <http://www.mediaphormedia.com/>`_, currently World
Online, and the birthplace of Django, I have been tasked with
porting `Ellington <http://ellingtoncms.com>`_. Ellington is the
CMS that we create and sell, and is what Django originally was.
Django was pulled out of Ellington and Open Sourced.

So when I got here, my first job was tasked with porting Ellington.
We have a version running on
`Revision 1290 <http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/1290>`_ and
.91. Aka, really damn old, pre-magic removal old. We were tasked
with porting this to Django 1.0 (which is around revision 9300).
That is a whole 8000 source code revisions, and 600% more revisions
than the base. That is a whole lot of code.

So today at work, we are launching our 3 main sites;
`Ljworld <http://ljworld.com>`_,
`KU Sports <http://kusports.com>`_, and
`Lawrence.com <http://lawrence.com>`_. These will be running all on
Django 1.0, which is a monumental task.

That is the reason today's post is short. Was bug fixing all day,
and I have to be up at 5am to go in and put out the fires that will
surely happen once users start hitting the site.

I will have an updated post afterward about the experience.
