New Design
==========

I just pushed my new site design live. My last post got lots of
hits and I was tired of the comments about how horrible the site
looks :). Please let me know what you think. There are still a
couple rough edges, but I think overall it is a lot better!

I would like to thank my brother for putting together the design. I
really like it! I hope everyone's eyes have stopped bleeding, and
you can now enjoy reading the site :). There are a couple rough
edges that will be worked out over the next couple days. Enjoy!
