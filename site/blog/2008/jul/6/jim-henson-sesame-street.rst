Jim Henson before Sesame Street
===============================

I'm currently reading Malcolm Gladwell's Tipping Point, and it is
an amazing book. One thing that he mentions is that the Muppets
were actually used by Jim Henson before Sesame Street to do
advertising! I never knew this, and find it fascinating. There are
a bunch on youtube that some posted. Great stuff!
