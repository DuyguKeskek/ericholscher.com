Living well
===========

Loving Lawrence still. I haven't had to fill up my gas tank since
I've been in town. My car probably hasn't moved in about 3 days. I
have established a pretty good schedule, and I have been living
really well.

I've been riding my bike to work all week, and it's been awesome.
It's only about a mile and it's a really pretty ride. I can either
go through downtown, or through the old neighborhoods in Lawrence.
Win-win I say. Tuesday and Friday afternoon's we play pickup soccer
in South Park, and that's been going really well. I forgot how much
I love playing soccer (played for 12+ years), and the only reason I
stopped was because I hurt my knees. I'm hoping I don't re-injure
myself, because that will mess up all my healthy activity. Now I
just need to start actually working out and lifting some weights.

There are lots of awesome cheap \* nights in town because of the
fact it's a college town. Here are a couple of the bigger one's
that I've happened upon so far. Monday's: $1 bowling games, $.30
wings at the bowling alley. $1.75 pints at the Free State Brewery
(Best Damn Brewery in Kansas!) Tuesday: 2 for 1 Ice Cream at the
Ice Cream place downtown! I'm sure there's more, but I can't think
of them right now. But those make the beginning of the week
awesome!

Plus my job is awesome. Working with great people doing interesting
stuffs. :)

Cheers!!
