DjangoCon 2008
==============

It is being kinda announced about DjangoCon 2008! It is going to be
in the Bay Area and sometime around the release of Django 1.0 in
September. I heard about it a couple days ago from Jacob at the
office (because I work at Mediaphormedia, birthplace of Django).
I'm really excited about it, and I'm thinking about heading out for
it. I have never been to the Bay Area. We'll see how it pans out
when it gets announced, but I'm almost definitely going! YAY!!

Update: An official announcement should be made Monday or Tuesday,
including dates and location.
