EuroDjangoCon Talk: Testing Django
==================================

Just got off the stage at
`EuroDjangocon <http://euro.djangocon.org/>`_, which was my first
real talk in front of the Django Community. I hope that people
enjoyed it, and that it was informational. Here are the slides to
my talk in
`PDF Form <http://media.ericholscher.com/slides/Testing%20slides.pdf>`_,
and on slideshare.

I hope that people have questions or constructive feedback, and I'd
love to hear what everyone thought. I will be writing a full
writeup at the end of the conference, but I'll say that it has been
amazing thus far!
