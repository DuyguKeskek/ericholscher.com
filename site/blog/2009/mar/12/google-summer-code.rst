Google Summer of Code
=====================

It's that time of year again, and the
`Google Summer of Code <http://code.google.com/soc/>`_ is happening
again. This year Django will be applying again, and there is
currently a
`Wiki page <http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/SummerOfCode2009>`_
on the Django wiki devoted to ideas and people who want to
volunteer to help mentor. I think this is a great opportunity for
students, mentors, and the projects involved. It is a really neat
learning experience. Even if you can't participate, it's a good
chance to put ideas up that some enterprising student might pick up
and run with.

Last year had some really successful work done, with Django's
`Aggregation <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/aggregation/>`_
framework,
`F Expressions <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/queries/#filters-can-reference-fields-on-the-model>`_,
and a
`revamped comments framework <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/>`_
all coming out of last years efforts!

This is your time to really help give back to the community and
help some neat, innovative work get done at the same time. You can
also show a student the value and fun in open source work. The
focus on SoC is in new feature development, so it's an exciting way
to hopefully get your pony into Django. So go add some ideas to the
wiki or volunteer to mentor if you have the time and knowledge.
Most of all if you're a student, apply! This is a really great
opportunity that Google provides you, you get paid, and you get to
help make something amazing!
