Token Testing Talk Slides: Djangocon 2009
=========================================

There are the slides to my Token Testing Talk from Djangocon. I'm
hoping the videos will be posted soon, but I think that it went
well. There were a lot of good questions, and I need to put some
recap posts up, but for now here is a copy of the slides.
